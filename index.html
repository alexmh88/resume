            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm an experienced vocalist, songwriter and guitarist.  
                Born in Des Moines, Iowa, but I've been living in Las Vegas for about 11 years now.<p>
            <p>I'm currently fronting two quite globally successful bands that you may have heard of.
                I've also got a solo project on the side and I've done multiple music collaborations with other artists and bands.
                My voice is pretty extraordinary and powerful. I master clean vocals, screaming and rapping - like a pro!
                People may think I've got an ugly face since I sometimes perform with a mask, but that's definetely not true.</p>
            <p>Apart from  my excellent skills in music, I do have some experience in acting,     
                producing  movies and writing books.
                I'm always up for new challenges and I work hard to achieve my goals.</p>
            <p>Nothing can stop me - the world is my oyster!</p>

            <h2>On Stage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Stone Sour:</b> Alternative Metal/Rock. I am the front vocalist and founding member.
                    Been active in the band 1992-1997 and 2000-present.
                    I occasionally also play guitar and keyboard. 
                    The band has released 6 studio albums and hits like "Through Glass" and "Absolute Zero"</li>
                <li><b>Slipknot:</b>The band that took the world with storm.
                    Slipknot can't be put in a genre we are our own genre, but sometimes people call
                    us Nu Metal. I'm the lead vocalist and I've been in the band since 1997 and is still active. Our thing is that we all wear masks when we perform. The band has relased 6 studio albums and 26 singles. We've won 29 awards and been nominated for various ones 63 times.</li>
                <li><b>CMFT</b> is my debut solo album that was relased 2020. 
                    You wouldn't hear these songs on on a Stone Sour or Slipknot album, this goes under another genre. Another proof of how such an amazingly talented musician I am. I ace whatever I'm working on.</li>
                <li> I've done many <b>guest appearances</b> on albums with bands like Code Orange, Apocalyptica, Soulfly and Steel Panther</li>
                <li>I did a collaboration with Dave Grohl, Rick Nielson & Scott Reeder. 
                    The result was the awesome single "From Can to Can't."</li>
